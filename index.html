                    We do not get to choose our families, but we do get to choose our friends. You have been closer than family to me. 
                    On this day of your birth, I wish you every happiness and blessing. Congratulations! You grew up one more year. 
                    Soon, you'll be 25, then 30, then 35, then 40 and so on. And, if things go right for you, then, in the meantime, 
                    you'll be achieving your goals, getting married, have kids, see your kids getting married and have grandchildren. 
                    And if you are lucky enough, you'll see your grandchildren marry as well. And then, eventually, you'll die. But 
                    mind you, these will only happen if things go right for you. Things might go wrong for you, and maybe some night, 
                    you might get highly drunk and jump off the terrace of a building thinking it's a swimming pool down there and die 
                    pitifully. No matter what, but eventually, you're going to die. And today, you are officially one year closer to 
                    your death. Being a friend of yours, I would like to express my condolence upon your death. But maybe, by the time 
                    you die, we might not be in contact with one another. So today, in the name of your oncoming death, I wholeheartedly 
                    express my grief in advance...
